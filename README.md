# **Smart Shopping Cart - Project Idea**

The **Smart Shopping Cart** project aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by integrating cutting-edge **AI technologies** and **computer vision** into traditional shopping carts. The idea is to create a cart capable of:
- Automatically detecting items placed inside it using a **camera and YOLOv8 object detection model**.
- Providing real-time feedback on item details, prices, and quantities through integrated systems.
- Simplifying the checkout process by instantly calculating the total cost without the need for manual scanning.

Additionally, the project incorporates **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to visualize and explain how the AI model recognizes and classifies items, ensuring transparency and improving debugging during development.

This innovative solution addresses common shopping challenges such as long queues and manual errors while enhancing efficiency and offering a convenient experience for users.
