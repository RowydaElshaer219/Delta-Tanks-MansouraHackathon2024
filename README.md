mart Shopping Cart - Project Idea
The Smart Shopping Cart project aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by integrating cutting-edge AI technologies and computer vision into traditional shopping carts. The idea is to create a cart capable of:

Automatically detecting items placed inside it using a camera and YOLOv8 object detection model.
Providing real-time feedback on item details, prices, and quantities through integrated systems.
Simplifying checkout by calculating the total cost instantly and eliminating manual scanning processes.
Additionally, the project incorporates Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize and explain how the AI model recognizes and classifies the items, ensuring transparency and better debugging during development.

This innovative solution addresses common shopping challenges, such as long queues and manual errors, while enhancing efficiency and user convenience.
